My team won the best project of social relevance award for creating a project that helps detect diabetic retinopathy using deep learning. Our main aim was to build this affordable product and sell it to hospitals in the suburbs because villages were lacking in hospitals. We made a model which consists of a 28D lens and a holder to hold the lens. With that, patients can fit their smartphones with this device and capture their eye (fundus) images. They can then upload the captured fundus image to our software, which uses a deep learning model, which then classifies the stages of retinal disease like diabetic retinopathy.
